### Final Projects

#### **Presentations are next week, Tue. 12/6 and Thu. 12/8**

- If your group wants to present on Tue. 12/6, let me know by Thursday.  

  - Otherwise, random order will be posted on Friday.

- Attendance required by all
  
- Dress: Business casual with emphasis on casual
  
- Suits, Ties, Dresses, and Jackets are **NOT** required
  
- No sweats t-shirts or pjs
    
- You will present better if you dress the part (at least a little)
  
- All students should be prepared to answer questions about the work presented.
    
- Each student will evaluate other groups and their own group members

* **All project components must be submitted by Tuesday, December 13th at 5:00 PM**

---

### Project Memos

- [Project Description - Memos are described on Page 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-DJ3yeHPpxcg1o12Cg2qc2Besb6Jw6UiyAo6gR4S2I/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Template for Memo to Supervisor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TceEQ-wr6ZF8WLdHQuFBUKuE8_6UiNsdrXS2O0lAEk/edit?usp=sharing)

   - Supervisor Memo's Goal: 
  
      - Provide your supervisor with what they need 
      - They will want to be knowledgeable about the data and dashboard, but have very limited time.
      - Predict questions they (supervisor) might have and questions a client might ask.

- [Template for memo to Colleague](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TceEQ-wr6ZF8WLdHQuFBUKuE8_6UiNsdrXS2O0lAEk/edit?usp=sharing)

   - Colleague Memo's Goal: 
    
      - Colleague should be able to follow memo to update dashboard quickly and seamlessly when new data are available.
      
      - I (or TAs) will follow memo and verify that instructions are clear, links are functional, and I can update dashboard based on this memo. when new data are available.
  
#### Questions about Project and Templates?

### R Markdown (.Rmd) and Quarto (.qmd) formats

- RStudio is currently in transition 

- Documents can be rendered from R Markdown (.Rmd) or [Quarto (.qmd)](https://quarto.org/)

  - HTML, Word documents, PDf

  - R Markdown will be available for forseeable future

  - flexdashboard not available in Quarto format yet
    - [Options Currently Available in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html)

- Presentations can be rendered from R Markdown (.Rmd) or Quart (.qmd)

  - Powerpoint 
  
     - better for non-technical talks
  
  - Quarto Presentations (RevealJS) will replace Xaringan
  
     - These slides are Xaringan
  
     - Updated options will make better slides with more options
  
     - Xaringan and RevealJS are preferred for including code and output

### Best way to learn Quarto

.pull-left[

<br>

- Examine Examples provided in R

- Examine Examples in [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)
  
  - click on code symbol `</>` to see the code used to create the documents or presentations 
  
  - Examine and modify code for your document
  
  - Also use Google, website documentation, and stack overflow for questions

### Resources - Where to go next 


<br>

.pull-left[

#### **For all aspects of analytics and R and RStudio**

- Discovered last semester: [Big Book of R - A Curated Website of R Resources](https://www.bigbookofr.com/index.html)
  - Updated November 2022
  
- Doesn't include [text reference for this class](https://rafalab.GitHub.io/dsbook/) which is good.
  
- Best resource I have found is Google which often leads to [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  
  - Stack Overflow is helpful but you have to know enough code to be able to understand answers.

### Tutorials
    
- As SU Students you also have free access to [Linkedin Learning](https://linkedinlearning.syr.edu/) 
  
  - Great tutorials in R, Python, SQL
  
  - Employers are likely to expect some familiarity with each.
    
  - R is most versatile and powerful
    
  - Employers may prefer Python, SQL, or another language/environment because that is what they know.
    
  - NOTE: Python, SQL, others can all be utilized through RStudio.
    
  - Different languages can be combined in one RMarkdown document in separate chunks.
    
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) - Not Free, but Excellent.
  
  - Provides certificates of completion
    
  - Published this excellent [document about data fluency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VoM3D6tPftjZpXCnTL8SKYBlOM_4KjG/view?usp=sharing)
     - **Download this document and save it for when you have to apply for jobs and answer questions about your skillset.**  
 
- Other companies are quickly developing tutorial training too (some are good)

### Sharing and Collaborating - GitHub vs. RPubs

- Last week I introduced you to Rpubs which is ideal from sharing a dashboard.

- Alternatively, you may have already come across `GitHub` in searching for files or a package.

  - Slides for this course are stored on GitHub
  
  - Required for files where data, code and text are maintained together as a project, referred to as a **repository** or **repo**.
  
  - Not required for finished dashboard.

- GitHub is an online code sharing and code development platform.  

- Many R packages start as development code on GitHub and over time they are refined and published.

---

### More about GitHub

- Once you create free account, you can learn more about how it works in this [tutorial](https://docs.GitHub.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

- Collaborative coding is common on GitHub but is a little more complex than working on a shared drive.

  - Developers of games, R packages, other software, etc., have huge code files and need to protect them.

  - There is a system in place (version control) where people can create a project with multiple code versions and edits.
    Over time a project develops more and more branches, like a tree, but the trunk.
  
  - Original code is preserved and changes can be incorporated as they are verified and approved.
  

### Some GitHub links
  
  - Some tutorial links for collaborative coding on GitHub:
  
    - [What is Git and GitHub? And how to use GitHub?](https://medium.com/@ravirajsubramanian/what-is-git-and-GitHub-and-how-to-use-GitHub-f49d6be08b25)
      
    - [How to use Git and GitHub for collaborative programming?](https://medium.com/@ravirajsubramanian/how-to-use-git-and-GitHub-for-collaborative-programming-955da6876aa9)

### Evaluations

* Course Evaluations are very important.

* Please take the time to fill out evaluations.

  - [You can login to the Course Evaluations website here](http://coursefeedback.syr.edu/)
  
    - netID and password are required
  
  - I will step out for 5 minutes. 
  
<br>
  
### Project Questions

 - The rest of class time can be used for group projects.
