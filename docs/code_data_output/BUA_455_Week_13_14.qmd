### Project Memos

- [Project Description - Memos are described on Page 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-DJ3yeHPpxcg1o12Cg2qc2Besb6Jw6UiyAo6gR4S2I/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Template for Memo to Supervisor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG_tuwnx1TqUUDIyCT37dtMTi3cC7tbdjbus9zUEBqc/edit?usp=sharing)

   - Supervisor Memo's Goal: 
  
      - Provide your supervisor with what they need 
      - They will want to be knowledgeable about the data and dashboard, but have very limited time.
      - Predict questions they (supervisor) might have and questions a client might ask.

- [Template for memo to Colleague](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TceEQ-wr6ZF8WLdHQuFBUKuE8_6UiNsdrXS2O0lAEk/edit?usp=sharing)

   - Colleague Memo's Goal: 
    
      - Colleague should be able to follow memo to update dashboard quickly and seamlessly when new data are available.
      
      - I (or TAs) will follow memo and verify that instructions are clear, links are functional, and I can update dashboard based on this memo. when new data are available.
      
  
#### Questions about Project and Templates?

---

### Talking about Your Skillset

- Explaining your skillset is hard, but it's getting easier.

- As Data Science and Analytics grow in importance, more people understand what this skill set can offer.

- However, you should not assume that interviewers, colleagues, supervisors understand your skills.

- [This White Paper from Data camp (also posted on Blackboard)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VoM3D6tPftjZpXCnTL8SKYBlOM_4KjG/view) is helpful.

  - Starting on Page 9 it lays out different roles people take on when working with data.
  
  - Comparing these descriptions to skills you learn in this major should give you a lot of confidence.
  
  - Provides validation that you can take on more advanced roles.

---

### R Markdown (.Rmd) and Quarto (.qmd) formats

- RStudio and parent company Posit is currently in transition.

- Documents can be rendered from R Markdown (.Rmd) or [Quarto (.qmd)](https://quarto.org/)

  - HTML, Word documents, PDf

  - R Markdown will be available for forseeable future

  - flexdashboard not available in Quarto format
  
    - [Options Currently Available in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html)
    
    - [Dashboard options were introduced in August of 2023](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)

- Presentations can be rendered from R Markdown (.Rmd) or Quart (.qmd)

  - Powerpoint 
  
     - better for non-technical talks
  
  - Quarto Presentations (RevealJS) will replace Xaringan
  
     - These slides are Xaringan
  
     - Updated options will make better slides with more options
  
     - Xaringan and RevealJS are preferred for including code and output
    
---
  
### Best way to learn Quarto



- Examine Examples provided in R

- Examine Examples in [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)
  
  - click on code symbol `</>` to see the code used to create the documents or presentations 
  
  - Examine and modify code for your document
  
  - Also use Google, website documentation, and stack overflow for questions


---
  
### Resources - Where to go next 


#### **For all aspects of analytics and R and RStudio**

- Discovered last year: [Big Book of R - A Curated Website of R Resources](https://www.bigbookofr.com/index.html)
  - Updated November 2023
  
- Doesn't include [this book](https://rafalab.GitHub.io/dsbook/) which is excellent for undergraduates.
  
- Before this Spring, the best resource was Google which often leads to [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  
  - Stack Overflow is helpful but you have to know enough code to be able to understand answers.
  
- Now, I recommend using and learning with AI such as Chat GPT (not during a test)
  
  - The AI engine is very good at answering most code questions, but it is not perfect.


---
    
### Tutorials
    
- As SU Students you also have free access to [Linkedin Learning](https://linkedinlearning.syr.edu/) 
  
  - Great tutorials in R, Python, SQL
  
  - Employers are likely to expect some familiarity with each.
    
  - R is most versatile and powerful
    
  - Employers may prefer Python, SQL, or another language/environment because that is what they know.
    
  - NOTE: Python, SQL, others can all be utilized through RStudio.
    
  - Different languages can be combined in one RMarkdown document in separate chunks.
    
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) - Not Free, but Excellent.
  
  - Provides certificates of completion
    
  - Published this excellent [document about data fluency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VoM3D6tPftjZpXCnTL8SKYBlOM_4KjG/view?usp=sharing)
     - **Download this document and save it for when you have to apply for jobs and answer questions about your skillset.**  
 
- Other companies are quickly developing tutorial training too (some are good)

### Sharing and Collaborating - GitHub vs. RPubs

- Last week I introduced you to Rpubs which is ideal from sharing a dashboard.

  - For MAS 261, I publish my slides on RPubs

- Alternatively, you may have already come across `GitHub` in searching for files or a package.

  - Slides for this course are stored on GitHub
  
  - Prior to Quarto, GitHub was required for files where data, code and text are maintained together as a project, referred to as a **repository** or **repo**.
  
  - Not required for finished dashboard.

- GitHub is an online code sharing and code development platform.  

- Many R packages start as development code on GitHub and over time they are refined and published.

---

### More about GitHub

- Once you create free account, you can learn more about how it works in this [tutorial](https://docs.GitHub.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

- Collaborative coding is common on GitHub but is a little more complex than working on a shared drive.

  - Developers of games, R packages, other software, etc., have huge code files and need to protect them.

  - There is a system in place (version control) where people can create a project with multiple code versions and edits.
    
    - Over time a project develops more and more branches, like a tree, but the trunk.
  
  - Original code is preserved and changes can be incorporated as they are verified and approved.
  
---

### Some GitHub links
  
  - Some tutorial links for collaborative coding on GitHub:
  
    - [What is Git and GitHub? And how to use GitHub?](https://medium.com/@ravirajsubramanian/what-is-git-and-GitHub-and-how-to-use-GitHub-f49d6be08b25)
      
    - [How to use Git and GitHub for collaborative programming?](https://medium.com/@ravirajsubramanian/how-to-use-git-and-GitHub-for-collaborative-programming-955da6876aa9)
          
    - [Using Git and Github on Group Projects](https://medium.com/@androidmatheny/using-git-and-GitHub-on-group-projects-d636be2cdd4d)
      
    - [Section 33 of Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/version-control.html)

### New Ways to Collaborate

**[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)** is not free (as you know) but I think it works well for collaborative work.
   - Note: I think only one person can edit a code file at same time. Is that true?

- For your purposes, it is $5 per month which you can pause when not working.

- You are my first course to use it for the project.

- You can choose which version of R and RStudio you want to work in and R packages always install and load without issue.

- You can organize work into R Projects the same way we do in class and share them with others.

**[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** is primarily used for Python but can be used with R.

- I have only started exploring this option but it appears to be a free Google collaborative data science space.

- Here is a [Medium article that explains how to use R in Google Colab](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-r-in-google-colab-b6e02d736497)

  - TLDR: Google Colab is more well developed for Python but useable for R and will evolve quickly.
  
---

### More New Ways to Collaborate
  
**[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)**

- You can create an account in Kaggle and save work in Notebooks and use a combination of R and Python in your work.

- Here is a [detailed example of an analysis and report using the Titanic Data done with R in a Kaggle Notbook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic/report).

- Here is a [tutorial for using R in Kaggle Notebook](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/run-r-markdown-in-kaggle/).

- Kaggle is well known for Data Science competitions.

**[Data World](https://data.world/)**

- Similar to Kaggle in that you can create an account and save projects there.

### Plan for Tuesday (12/5)

- Address submitted questions

  - Quarto and R Markdown

- Tips for a Better Dashboard

- Tables with GT

- Five minutes for evaluations

- In-class work time



---

### Tips for a Better Dashboard

A good rule for this project (every project):

***Edit yourself***

- You may have a lot to say and show, **BUT** always consider:

  - **What can you present WELL in the space an time you have?**

- An important skill to develop is the ability to filter the data to a representative subset, especially for a visualization.

- Think about what data can be presented well and what the audience can digest.  

- Don't try to show too much in any one plot or panel.

- You can always show other parts of the data by

  - creating more panels 
  - creating multi-plot grids to show other part of the data



---

### Tips for a Better Dashboard

At each stage of the process, take a step back and examine each dashboard panel as if you are seeing it with fresh eyes.

- As you do that, as yourself these questions:

- Does this panel achieve a specific goal?

- Is the point of this panel clear?

- If not, how can I edit or augment this panel to clarify what it is showing?

- Are the text and symbols readable from any distance?

- What can I simplify to make it more clear?

  - Are there aspects I think are important that might not be obvious?
  
  - If so, how can I modify the panel or dashboard to highlight the key aspects?
  
- When in doubt, ask someone like a roommate to look it and ask if they understand what you hope to convey.

---

### Tables in Dashboards and Documents

- This course focuses mostly on data visualizations, with a few table summaries.

- Creating a more complex table, may be useful to you and could be included as an additional main panel in your dashboard instead of side panel.

  - Not required, but it may be helpful.  

- Even if you don't use `gt` tables in your dashboard, they will definitely be helpful if you use R and RStudio to manage, analyze, and document data in the future.

- If you have not already done so, please rerun the setup for this lecture, which now includes the `gt` package and the package.

- The [`gt` website](https://gt.rstudio.com/index.html) has many examples with detailed step by step instructions.

- Notes about examples on `gt` website:

  - Examples use the older pipe notation `%>%` which is identical in function to `|>`.
  
  - Examples also use different commands to complete the same data management tasks covered in BUA 455.
  
  - If you are unsure about a command you come across ask me, or google it.  The R help index is also good.
      - e.g. `?glue` or `?glue::glue` is the glue command in glue package

---

### Tables in Dashboards and Documents

First let's look at what can be customized:

.center[<img src="docs_files/images/gt_table.png" width="800">]


---

### Example: Importing, Summarizing and Displaying Stock Data

```{r stock import and summary}

getSymbols("^GSPC", from="2022-07-01", to="2023-04-01") 

snp9 <- GSPC |>
  fortify.zoo() |> as_tibble(.name_repair = "minimal") |>
  rename("date" = "Index") |>
  mutate(mnth=month(date))|>
  group_by(mnth) |>
  filter(date==max(date)) |>  # filtered data to last day of each month
  ungroup() |>
  select(-c(6,8))    # remove volume and month variables
names(snp9)[2:6] <- c("Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Adjusted")
head(snp9,3)

```

---

### Example: Importing, Summarizing and Displaying Stock Data

- The code below does not make a new tibble or data frame
- Instead it create a formatted table object that can be output as a .png file like a plot.

  - `kable` also creates a formatted table object, but `gt` has more features.

- As with plots, I am saving this object and then displaying it on the next slide.

```{r create formatted gt table}
snp_fmt <- snp9 |>
  gt(rowname_col = "date") |>
  tab_header(title = "S&P 500",
             subtitle = "Last Trading Day of Previous Nine Months") |>
  tab_stubhead(label = "Date") |>
  fmt_date(columns=date, date_style=3) |>  # formats date
  fmt_currency(columns=Open:Adjusted, currency = "USD")|>     # formats values as US$
  tab_footnote("Data Source: https://finance.yahoo.com") |>
  tab_footnote("Symbol: ^GSPC")

```

---

In a dashboard or document, the code would be hidden, but it is shown here:

```{r display formatted table}
snp_fmt         # code to display created table
```

---

### Editing a Table for a Presentation



- A table in dashboard side panel should be small.

- Previous table would not fit, but we can select variables and shorten the date.

- Limit the table to key variables that highlight important characteristics of your data.

- Other variables, e.g. `Open`, `Low`, can be shown in plot

```{r edited smaller table}
snp_sm <- snp9 |>
select(1,3,6) |>
  gt(rowname_col = "date") |>
  tab_header(title = "S&P 500",
             subtitle = "Last Trading Day of Previous Nine Months") |>
  tab_stubhead(label = "Date") |>
  fmt_date(columns=date, date_style=6) |>                   
  fmt_currency(columns=High:Adjusted, 
               currency = "USD")|>     
  tab_footnote("Source: https://finance.yahoo.com") |>
  tab_footnote("Symbol: ^GSPC")
```



```{r show snp_sm, echo=F}
snp_sm
```
