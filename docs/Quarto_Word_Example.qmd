## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

<br>

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

<br>

## Code and Output in Word Document

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

<br>

## In-line code Example

The following text includes in-line code. A linear model is created and saved in the R chunk. and then components of that model output used in the sentence that follows.

```{r cars model, echo = T}
cmod <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
scmod <- summary(cmod)
```

Based on the available data in the base R software (R Core team, 2022), stopping distance in feet for cars in the 1920s was estimated as `r  round(cmod$coefficients[1],2)` + `r round(cmod$coefficients[2],2)` x speed (mpg). and the R^2^ for this linear model is `r round(scmod$r.squared,2)`.

## Basic Plot

```{r cars plot}
plot(cars)
```

## Star Wars Plot from Week 1

```{r formatted starwars plot, fig.align='center'}

my_starwars_plt <- starwars |>
  select(species, sex, height, mass) |>
  filter(species %in% c("Human", "Droid")) |>
  mutate(bmi = mass/((height/100))^2) |>
  filter(!is.na(bmi)) |>
  mutate(sexF = factor(sex, 
                       levels = c("male", "female", "none"),
                       labels =c("Male", "Female", "None")))

# formatted plot with factor variable, text formatted, and borders
(sw_box4 <- my_starwars_plt |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=species, y=bmi, fill=sexF)) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  labs(title="Comparison of Human and Droid BMI",
       subtitle="22 Humans and 4 Droids from Star Wars Universe",
       caption="Data Source: dplyr package in R",
       x="",y="BMI", fill="Sex") + 
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "lightgrey", fill=NA, linewidth=2)))
```
